				<h5 class="reg">Actually, there is <u class="em str">one way</u> you can lose… </h5>
				<p><strong>By letting doubt and cynicism <span class="rt">get in the way</span></strong> of the love and passion you want so much (that you deserve so much)…</p>
				<p>I’ve done everything I can to convince Michael to give you this opportunity, <strong>but only <em class="rt">you</em> can take that final step</strong> towards a happier and so-much-more connected relationship with men…</p>
				<p>To make your husband, your boyfriend or even a man you just met become completely <strong><em>addicted</em> to you</strong> so even the idea of being with another woman makes him sick…</p>
				<p>Just click the button below…</p>
				<p><strong>Relax and accept the help you <em>need</em></strong> to finally have the passion and love and power you crave so deeply…</p>
				<p>I personally promise you’ll be <strong><em>very</em> happy</strong> you did.</p>
				<p><strong>Because I’m so happy <em class="rt">I did…</em></strong></p>
				<p><strong>I’m so happy I learned</strong> what Michael had to teach, used what he taught me and got off the disappointment roller coaster <strong class="rt">for good…</strong> </p>
				<h5 class="reg">In fact, I have a <strong class="em">nightmare</strong> sometimes…</h5>
				<p>A <strong>nightmare where I <em class="u">didn’t</em> trust my gut</strong> and learn what Michael had to teach me…</p>
				<p>Where things with John and I ended just like they did with every guy�&nbsp;before…</p>
				<p>Whenever I have that nightmare I wake up in a cold sweat <strong>terrified I’ve gone back to that life…</strong></p>
				<p>Then I look at John laying next to me…</p>
				<p>The man I use the techniques in “Make Him Worship You” with every day to keep him devoted, even <strong>addicted to me…</strong></p>
				<p>And I smile, cuddle up to him, feel the steady thump of his <strong>heartbeat</strong> as he pulls meclose…</p>
				<p>And go back to sleep more content and happy than I’ve ever been…</p>
				<p><strong>I want <em>you</em> to feel that too…</strong></p>
				<p>And you can…</p>
				<p>But only if you click the button below and enroll in “Make Him Worship You” <strong>right now before <span class="u">it’s too late…</span></strong></p>
				<p>My name is Kate Murray and I’m <strong>incredibly excited for <em>you</em> to join me</strong> in experiencing what happens when you apply “Make Him Worship You” in your life… </p>
